Applying framework to study state engagement variability (SEV) in development 

Publication: "Variation in moment-to-moment brain state engagement changes across development and contributes to individual differences in executive function" Neuron (2025)

**Within this folder**

**centroid.mat** -- recurring brain states extracted from the Human Connectome Project dataset (dimension: brain nodes x brain state; first column: fixation; second column: high-cognition; third column: low-cognition; fourth column: transition)

**extact_sev** -- example scripts extracting SEV from participants (pnc_sev.m: with scrubbing; hbn_sev.m: without scrubbing) and identifying the when developmental trajectories stabilized

**ef_pred** -- predict EF with SEV

**age_pred** -- predict brain age with SEV

**Additional information**

The codes were written and tested in MATLAB_R2021a.
